# Hat

## General Info
As Discord decided to take away my Active Developer Badge, I decided to recreate my old bot, which was back then named **Crown**.
This time, its purpose is to answer the user's questions in a very metaphorical way.
It was created entirely for fun, and I have changed its name to **Hat**.

## License
Projects License is based on ISC one. This project was mainly made using the [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/) library. [ESLint](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint) was also used for several things."
